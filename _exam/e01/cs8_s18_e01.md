<p> NOTE: All references to <b>Python</b> on this exam mean <b>Python 3</b>,
so you should answer accordingly.</p>

<ol>


<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:2in;" markdown="1"> (5 pts) A complete Python program that prints out the following message
is a very short program indeed:


<pre style="width:auto; border: none;">
I can code!
</pre>

Please write that entire program in the space below.  You certainly have
more space than you will need.

</li>



<li style="margin-bottom:3.0in;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Many products in the United States that are sold by weight
are measured in ounces, while in most other countries, they are measured in grams.   One ounce is approximately 28.3495 grams, and the abbreviation for ounce is `oz`.

Given this information, write the definition of a Python function called `oz2g` that takes
a parameter called `ounces` and returns the corresponding value in grams.

</li> 

<li markdown="1"> (5 pts) Now write a function call to this function,
as you might type it at the Python prompt, for example, that computes
the number of grams equal to 3 ounces.

</li>

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;"> Testing a Python function can be done with the `pytest`
module, as we did in lab02 and lab03 in this course.  The [handout](handout)
you got with this exam has example code illustrating `pytest` test cases.

<ol>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 1.5in;"> (10 pts) Why do we need the `pytest.approx` thing?   That is, why can't we just write: `assert cToF(100.0)==212.0`?

</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 2.5in;"> (12 pts) Now consider the `oz2g` function you write earlier.   Please write
two test cases for that function appropriate for use with `pytest`.   For convenience, here is a table of two
values you may use:


<style>
div.test-case-table {
   float:right; width:15em;
}
div.test-case-table table * {
 text-align:center;
}
</style>

<div class="test-case-table" markdown="1">

| ounces | grams        |
|--------|--------------|
| 2.5    | 70.8738      |
| 3      | 85.0486      |

</div>


</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:1in;" > (10 pts) When using test cases, we often write a "stub" before writing the correct function definition.
Write a function definition for `oz2g` that illustrates this practice&mdash;that is, a function definition for `oz2g` with a "stub".


</li>


</ol>

</li>




<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:2.5in;">(3 pts) To start work on a Python program you need to type a command that brings up the Integrated Development Environment for Python (version 3).  What is this command? 
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1"> Assuming the following assignment statements have been entered at the Python prompt:

```python
school = "UC Santa Barbara"
abbrev = "UCSB"
course = "CS8"
qtr = "M17"
campuses = ["UCSB","UCLA","Harvard","Yale","Stanford"]
colors = ["red","green","blue"]
colors.append("purple")
colors.append("blue")
```

Indicate the value of each of these expressions:

<style>
div.evenbigger table * td { padding: 2em 1pt 2em 1pt; text-align: center; }
div.evenbigger table * th { padding: 0em 1pt 0em 1pt; margin: 0 0 0 0;
  text-align:center;}
  div.evenbigger table * td code { padding: 0pt 1em 0pt 1em; }
  span.wider { padding: 0pt 6em 0pt 6em; }
  </style>


<div class="evenbigger" markdown="1">

| | Expression  | <span class="wider">Result</span> | | | Expression  | <span class="wider">Result</span> |
|---------|-------------|--------|-|--------|-------------|--------|
| (3 pts) | `2 + 3 * 5`        |  | | (3 pts) | `10 % 3` | |
| (3 pts) | `abbrev * 2`        |  | | (3 pts) | `len(qtr)` | |
| (3 pts) | `qtr[0:2]`          |  | |(3 pts) | `campuses[1]<campuses[2]`   | |
| (3 pts) | `course[-1]`        |  | |(3 pts) | `len(campuses) <= 8`   | |
| (3 pts) | `'E' not in abbrev` |  | |(3 pts) | `len(campuses[1])`      | |
| (3 pts) | `len(colors)` |        | (3 pts) | `colors[-1][-1]`     |        |
| (3 pts) | `colors[0]`    |        | (3 pts) | `colors[2][0]` |        |
| (3 pts) | `len(colors[1])`    |        | (3 pts) | `"e" in colors[0]`    |    
</div>
<li>
