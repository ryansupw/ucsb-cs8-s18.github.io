<p> NOTE: All references to <b>Python</b> on this exam mean <b>Python 3</b>,
so you should answer accordingly.</p>

<ol>

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1">Please refer to the [handout](handout) that came with this exam, and find the <b>Example `pytest` test cases from lab03</b> at the top of page 1 of the handout.

The third test case uses `pytest.approx`, while the other two don't.

Provide brief answers to these questions:

<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:6em;">(4 pts) What is the specific problem that arises with the third test case, but not with the first two?
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1">(4 pts) How does `pytest.approx` address that problem?
</li>
</ol>

</li>



<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:0em;" markdown="1"> Draw the characters in the boxes below as indicated:

<style>

<div class="bigrows">

| pts | character | draw it here |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| (2 pts) | forward slash |   |
| (2 pts) | backslash |  |

<li markdown="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom:1em;"> What are the Unix commands that do each of the following:

<ol>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (2 pts) List contents of your current directory
</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (2 pts) List contents of your current directory, showing permissions such as `rwxr-xr-x`?
</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (2 pts) Show the absolute path of the current working directory? 
</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (2 pts) Change current working directory to my home directory?
</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (2 pts) Change current working directory to `cs8` under my current directory?
</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (2 pts) Create a new directory called `lab09` under the current directory?	
</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (2 pts) Asssuming I have a file called lab09.py in my current directory, <br> change its permissions to `rwxr-x---`?
</li>

</ol>

</li>



<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;clear:left;"> In test driven development, we often write a stub for a function before we write the correct definition of that function.

<ol> <li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:15em;"> (5 pts) Suppose
that you were asked to write a function called `smallestOdd`.  The
function should take a parameter called `alist` which should be a
non-empty list of integers.  The function should return the smallest
odd integer.

In the space below write a *stub definition* for this function,
following the test-driven development practices taught in the CMPSC 8
labs this quarter.  Write *only* a stub definition for this function,
and nothing else.

</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:0em;"> (5 pts) Now write two suitable test cases for `smallestOdd` in the `pytest` style.   (As a reminder, the handout that came with this exam has some example `pytest` test cases).
</li>

</ol>

<li >Perform the number conversions indicated.

<style>
ol.numconv li {

</style>

<ol class="numconv">
<li> (2 pts) Convert 12 from octal to binary
</li>
<li> (2 pts) Convert 1000 0111 from binary to decimal

</li>
<li> (2 pts) Convert 110 000 110 from base 2 to base 8

</li>

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before" markdown="1">  You are interviewing for a part-time job working on a research project with a professor at UCSB.   The job involves a bit of Python coding.  The professor asks you the following questions. You are not sure whether they are "testing you" (and they know the correct answers), or whether they really don't know and they are curious.

Either way, you want to give an answer that is helpful, but *brief*&mdash;too long, and the professor will think you are tedious, and won't want to hire you.  But too vague, or incorrect, and the professor will think you really don't know your stuff.

How do you answer in a way that gets you the job?

<ol>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 10em;">(4 pts) "Sometimes I see this line at the top of a Python file.  What's it for?"

```

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 10em;">(4 pts) "Sometimes I see code like this in a Python file.  What's going on here?

```

   # more code goes here

```

<li  class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:2in; clear:left;">
As discussed in lecture, the Python interpreter has to keep track of
all of the local variables in a running Python program, and the progress
of functions as they are called and as they return.

Here are some questions about that. 

<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:4em;"> (3 pts)
There is a special part of the computer's memory
that keeps track of local variables, and information about each
function that is in progess.  What is the name given to this area in
memory?
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:4em;"> (2 pts)
Does a function call cause this part of the computer's memory to grow in
size or shrink?
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:4em;"> (2 pts)
Does returning from a function call cause this part of the computer's memory to grow in size or shrink?
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:4em;"> (2 pts)
There is a special word associated with putting something new into this area of memory.   What is that word?
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:4em;"> (2 pts)
There is a special word associated with removing something from this area of memory.  What is that word?
</li>

</ol>

<li class="page-break-before what-output" markdown="1"> On the handout, you'll find several attempts at writing
a function to find the index of the shortest string in a list with names
such as `indexShortest_a`, `indexShortest_b`, etc.  Please locate those on the
handout before reading further.

These functions are intended to operate as follows:

* If the parameter alist is not a list, is empty, or contains anything that
  is not of type `str`, then raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.
* Otherwise, return the index of the shortest string.
* If there is a tie, i.e. two or more strings of equal length, return the
   index that is the <b>smallest index</b> among the indexes of all strings
  of that length. For example for `['bear','dog','cat']`, return
   `1` for `'dog'` because it has a smaller index than `2` for `'cat'`.


<p style="clear:both;">That is how the functions are supposed to work.   However, any or all of them <b>may or may not contain bugs</b>.</p>

Your job is to *do what Python would do* with this code, i.e. indicate the output of the function call shown.

Assume that it has been loaded into `idle3` and that we've selected `Run Module` (or pressed F5.)    Then we typed in the function call shown, and something is printed as a result.  

Which of the answers shown matches what is printed?   Put a check mark (&#x2714;) in the appropriate column.  The first is done for you as an illustration
